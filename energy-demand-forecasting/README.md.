### **Workflow**
1. **Data Sources**
   - Smart Meter Data: Real-time consumption patterns.
   - Weather API: Temperature, humidity, and other factors influencing demand.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing or noisy data.
   - Feature engineering: time-of-day, seasonality, occupancy patterns.

3. **Model Training**
   - Baseline: XGBoost for quick results.
   - Advanced: LSTM or Transformer-based models for time-series forecasting.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE to measure forecasting accuracy.
   - Compare baseline vs advanced models.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy on **Azure Machine Learning** or **Streamlit** for interactive dashboards.
   - Automate retraining for continuous improvement.

6. **User Interface**
   - Visual dashboard showing predicted demand curves.
   - Insights for facility managers and grid operators.
